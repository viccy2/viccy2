# Victor Aremu David 👋
### Backend & Distributed Systems Engineer | Scalable Systems • Python • TypeScript • Go • Kubernetes • Cloud Infrastructure.

I specialize in building resilient, high-throughput backend architectures and MLOps pipelines. My focus is on optimizing distributed systems for performance, scalability, and 99.9% availability.

## 🚀 Impact at a Glance
- **High-Scale Systems:** Architected a YOLO-based ML compliance engine handling **10,000+ daily evaluations** with horizontal autoscaling.
- **Performance Optimization:** Reduced API latency by **30%** and minimized timeouts by **60%** through distributed task queuing (BullMQ/Redis).
- **Observability:** Halved debugging time (**50% reduction**) by implementing structured logging and Prometheus-based alerting.
- **Infrastructure:** Expert in container orchestration (Kubernetes) and automating CI/CD pipelines to increase team velocity by **40%**.
