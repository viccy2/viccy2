# Victor Aremu David 👋
### Backend & Distributed Systems Engineer | Scalable Systems • Python • TypeScript • Go • Kubernetes • Cloud Infrastructure.

I specialize in building resilient, high-throughput backend architectures and MLOps pipelines. My focus is on optimizing distributed systems for performance, scalability, and 99.9% availability.

## 🚀 Impact at a Glance

* **Large-Scale ML Orchestration**: Architected a **YOLO-based CV engine** processing **10k+ daily evaluations**; implemented Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) to maintain **99.9% uptime** during 40% traffic surges.
* **System Reliability & Throughput**: Engineered a distributed task queuing architecture (**BullMQ/Redis**) that reduced API timeouts by **60%** and increased system throughput by **50%** for 10k+ DAU.
* **Platform Engineering & Velocity**: Accelerated time-to-market by **40%** by standardizing infrastructure via **Terraform (IaC)** and automating CI/CD pipelines, eliminating configuration drift across 12+ microservices.
* **Operational Excellence**: Reduced MTTR by **50%** through a full-stack observability suite (**Prometheus/Grafana**) and structured logging for proactive anomaly detection.
* **Architectural Migration**: Spearheaded a **zero-downtime** monolith-to-microservices migration using API Gateway patterns, resulting in a **30% reduction** in end-to-end latency.
